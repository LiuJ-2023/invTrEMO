Source code of "Bayesian Inverse Transfer in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization"
The details about the implementation can be found in demo.ipynb. In the algorithm, the optimizer for the hyperparameter of the InvTGP is from https://github.com/rfeinman/pytorch-minimize. We will soon write a more detailed README for the code.
